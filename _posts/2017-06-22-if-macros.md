title: Another Useful If Macro

One of my favorite features of Clojure are the `if-` macros.
Specifically, `if-let`.
They're very useful as a way to help improve code readability.

My current project, a GraphQL service using Alumbra, requires a lot of lines like `(if (seq c) then else)`.
Unfortunately, you can't really finagle the current `if-` macros to run that test properly.

Given a value `c` and a macro like `(if-seq [a col] then else)` I need the following behavior:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If `a` is a non-empty collection of any sort (seq, vector, set, map, etc...) evaluate `then`, otherwise, evaluate false.

With those requirements, I came up with this.

```clojure
(defmacro if-seq
  "bindings => binding-form test

  If test is a seq, evaluates then with binding-form bound to the value of
  test, if not, yields else"
  ([bindings then]
   `(if-seq ~bindings ~then nil))
  ([bindings then else & oldform]
   (assert-args
    (vector? bindings) "a vector for its binding"
    (nil? oldform) "1 or 2 forms after binding vector"
    (= 2 (count bindings)) "exactly 2 forms in binding vector")
   (let [form (bindings 0) tst (bindings 1)]
     `(let [temp# ~tst]
        (if (seq temp#)
          (let [~form temp#]
            ~then)
          ~else)))))
```

If you dig through the Clojure core namespace, this will look pretty familiar.
Why?
It's almost the _exact_ same code as `if-let`.
The only difference is in `(if (seq temp#) ...` near the bottom.
In `if-let`, this line is `(if temp# ...`.
The simliarity is painful almost so lets expand it.

```clojure
(defmacro if-pred
  ([pred bindings then]
   `(if-pred ~pred ~bindings ~then nil))
  ([pred bindings then else & oldform]
   (assert-args
    (vector? bindings) "a vector for its binding"
    (nil? oldform) "1 or 2 forms after binding vector"
    (= 2 (count bindings)) "exactly 2 forms in binding vector")
   (let [form (bindings 0) tst (bindings 1)]
     `(let [temp# ~tst]
        (if (~pred temp#) ;; <--
          (let [~form temp#]
            ~then)
          ~else)))))
```

Check out __that__ microscopic change.
What's it do?
It allows you to do all of this fun stuff,

```clojure
(if-pred even? [a 2] true false)
;;=> true

(if-pred #(= 4 %) [a 2] true false)
;;=> false

(if-pred (fn [[a b]] (< a b)) [pair [2 4]] true false)
;;=> true

(if-pred (fn [[a b]] (< a b)) [pair [12 4]] true false)
;;=> false

;; And going back to the original intent ...

(if-pred seq [a [1 2 3]] a [])
;;=> [1 2 3]

(if-pred seq [a nil] a [])
;;=> []

(if-pred seq [a []] a [])
;;=> []
```

P.S. 
I'm using another macro in there called `assert-args`. 
This is a private macro in the `clojure.core` namespace. 
The macros will work fine without those lines in them if you don't want to add the macro.
If you do want to add the macro so that you have the error checks/logging, here you go!

```clojure
(defmacro ^{:private true} assert-args
  [& pairs]
  `(do (when-not ~(first pairs)
         (throw (IllegalArgumentException.
                 (str (first ~'&form) " requires " ~(second pairs) " in " ~'*ns* ":" (:line (meta ~'&form))))))
       ~(let [more (nnext pairs)]
          (when more
            (list* `assert-args more)))))
```
