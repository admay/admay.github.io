As a developer, it's easy for me to stay on the bleeding edge of all things tech. 
Code libraries, hardware, software, operating systems, etc...
It's all in my job description.
It's also something that I enjoy doing.

Many people and companies aren't like me.
They aren't paid to know the ins and outs of everything on their machines.
Their jobs could be in unrelated fields completely out of touch with tech.
They could be entirely uninterested.
Or, they could just not know where to look for news/updates.
That's all prefectly fine as long as you have some way of staying up to date.

Automatic updates to currently supported systems like Windows operating systems, Java's runtime, etc...
have made this process very easy for the casual user.
It depends on one thing though, the user.
As long as the user doesn't fight the change for too long, their computer will remain secured.
__Don't be the one to fight the change__.

For large companies it gets a little bit trickier.
And frankly, much more expensive.

Not all companies are tech forward.

Take a lumber yard for instance.
They have a computer that they depend on daily for all of their operations.
Orders, inventory, purchases, job requests, etc... all go through this one system.
Now this system has been working for them since 1999.
In their eyes, it's perfect.
However, it only runs on Windows 98.
That's a major problem.
Windows 98 completely lost support in 2006.
That's a long time for people to tinker around knowing that any vulnerabilities they find wont be fixed.
Hmm...

Now I hate being interuppted while working to update my laptop, but that update serves a purpose.
When your OS tells you, "Hey, I have a really important security update for you".
It means it has a really important security update for you.
Not allowing your system to update is like a bank finding out that theres a hole in the wall leading directly to the
safe and not fixing it.
It's not an easy thing for non-tech companies to always be up to date on all of their systems, but security
isn't something __any__ company can afford to slip on.
