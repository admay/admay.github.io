title: Information Overload
category: programming
---

I've been suffering from some serioius information overload lately.
Forcing yourself to learn isn't an easy thing to do.

I caught myself slipping recently and decided to go back into full on research mode.
When I started, I hit the ground running.
Eventually though, I came to a fork in the road.
The 'now what' fork.
Not knowing which route to take, I did what anyone in my position would do.
I Googled it.
I was met with, as you might expect, a tsunami of information.
Information overload.

Rather than trying to swim a mile against the current, I'm taking a shot break from code outside of work.
I decided that a little time to reflect on what I know and what I want to know would be good.
It turns out that it is.
As a way to make it past this rut, I'm going to be putting together a 'how-to' for Clojure.
The goal for this project will be to teach younger developers how to build something from start to end.
The major emphasis of this will be planning with minor emphases on code and the general ideas of web app development.

#### The Plan

I'm going to build a web application.

__The Stack__
1. Clojure
2. ClojureScript
3. Postgres
4. Heroku

__The Ideas__
- Use a REST web service
- Build a reactive front end with Reagent
- auth
- Interface with a Postgres DB using clojure.java.jdbc
- Have a self auditing database that records transaction IDs
- Create an 'easy button' for one-click deployments

__The Content__
- I'm not sure about this one yet. I'm thinking maybe some kind of forum site.
- I like the idea of users having profiles to demostrate authentication.
- I also like the idea of realtime updates.

Stay tuned for more updates!
