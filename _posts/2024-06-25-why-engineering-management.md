It's not a growth thing, it's a career change.

I grew up surrounded by educators.
Teachers, social workers, principals, librarians, you name it.
The adults in my life were all involved with teaching the younger generations.
It's something that I quickly became passaionate about.
I grew up wanting to be an educator.

The most fulfilling memories of my career are the times where I've been a guide.
Seeing that lightbulb go off for the junior dev learning something new.
Guiding a mid-level developer in leading a project for the first time to help them grow.
Watching that senior graduate to principle.
That's what keeps me going in this industry.

I've been asked a few times why I want to be an EM.
I love building things and I do enjoy seeing a system I built or helped build bring a product together.
Technology is great and there are some genuinely interesting problems in the world that I'd love to help solve.

The thing that I find most fulfilling in my work though, is ,and I think always will be, helping someone grow.
