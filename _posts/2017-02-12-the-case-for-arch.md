title: The Case for Arch
---

If you ask me Windows (any version) is bad.
I don't like the focus of the company any more and I resent their 'operation system'.
Mac isn't as bad because it at least has a decent shell, but that's really it.
Apple is still watching your every move.

Linux is great.
It's open source so I don't have to fork over any money for it.
I also don't feel like the governments of the world are watching me, which is nice.
And I can make it look however I want. 
Thank God for DWM!

Most people see Arch users as ego-maniacs.
Well, they are.
The Arch community is filled with more hot air than __new__ ideas.
It's a pretty harsh community.
However, if you can hang, you at least know you don't suck that bad at Linux.

That's where I'm at.
I don't suck _that_ bad.
I can compile from source.
I can fix some less-than-simple breaks.
I can prevent my system from breaking.
And most importantly, I can figure out what's wrong.
The reason why I love Arch so much, is because Arch forced me to solve problems.

About a year ago, I couldn't even install Arch.
Today, I have successfully install Gentoo.
I'm never going to do it again, but I know enough know that I can take a few ingredients and turn it into Linux.
That's a good feeling because I just discovered Stali Linux.
That's some advanced, good-luck-see-you-never stuff.

If you're going to install Linux to learn, making it past the Arch Linux phase is important.
It's that phase where you take off the training wheels and your hand is no longer held.
You learn how to solve OS related issues when an update breaks Xorg.
Compiling from the AUR means you are no longer tied to a package manager.
Taking a couple of hours a week and fiddling with the UI means you can build the perfect environment for you.

It's not a big deal anymore, being able to run an Arch system.
With the Arch Wiki and YouTube avilable, you can train a monkey to install Arch.
However, I still got a lot out of working with Arch for the past year or so.
For anyone that's bored with Ubuntu but not quite ready for LFS, I strongly suggest a run at Arch.
