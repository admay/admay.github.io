They should always be for the benefit of you team memebers. Fair warning, these are notes, not full sentences.

### The Short of it

- Build a relationship: This is space to get to know someone beyond the daily grind and deadlines. Learn motivations, aspirations, and challenges.
- Be open, be safe: Be the person that your team can lean on to voice concerns and frustrations. Address the small problems early and often.
- Support the individual: This is your time and chance to tailor support to each of the unique people on your team. Make it about them.
- Recognition and Feedback: If it isn't positive, it better be constructive. No IC should leave a 1 on 1 feeling like things are slipping away.
- Respect time: Your IC's set the time, not you. Don't break up a focus time block.
- Listen, focus, follow up: Listen actively and thoughtfully, focus on the discussion for the individual, and follow up on action items and commitments.
- Encourage Upward Feedback: It's easy to forget that managers can improve too and the best source of how is from the people.
