title: Learning how to Learn Spacemacs
---

A few years ago, I tried to make a big switch to Vim.
I was tired of using IDEs.
I always felt so disconnected from the project I was working on.

### A Little Background

After looking around for a bit, I found Vim and Emacs.
Emacs with the Ctrl and the Meta (like WTF is Meta!?) and the Alt... 
No way... 
Too many buttons.
Vim it is!
_That was a mistake._

I had no idea how Vim worked, how to configure it, or where to find new
packages for it.
All I actually knew was `:wq` and `:x` because they were the same thing.
After fumbling around for a few weeks, not knowing what to do, I gave it up.

About a year later, I found this goofy looking language called Clojure.
I initially started using LightTable since it was easy to get up and running.
I hit a wall though.
LightTable wasn't getting it done for me anymore. 
So I took the plunge and installed Emacs.

### It Was Bad.

As you might imagine, I broke a couple things every once in a while.
I also overwrote the binding for `C-g` by accident.
Oops...
If it wasn't for the 
[Brave Clojure]() 
book, I wouldn't have ever escaped that purgatory.
I learned a thing or two about using Cider and moving around.
I didn't get far with it though.

__That's about the time that I found Spacemacs.__

It was glorious.

Everything I was looking for... __in documentation__.
The number of tutorials I found (specifically relating to Clojure)
was like striking gold.

That's when I had my epihpony.
It's not that Emacs and Vim are bad editors for me.
It's not that I didn't have potential to become fluent in them.
__I just didn't know how to learn how to use them!__

When you need to learn a new language, the first thing you do is look up some documentation.
Same thing as when you need to learn a new library or framework.
You don't just _guess_ at the syntax until you get it right _and then_ look up how it's done.
So why should the approach to new tooling be any different?

I decided to put my Clojure learning aside for a little bit to focus more on my tooling.
I knew how to work in Spacemacs but I didn't know how to really be productive.
After a solid week of just reading, watching, and practicing, I finally figured it out.
I'm going to need another couple of weeks... or years.
