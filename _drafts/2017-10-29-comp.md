Without diving too deep into the 'why' of function composition, here's a Clojure tool to help you use it.

### What is it?

> Takes a set of functions and returns a fn that is the composition
> of those fns.  The returned fn takes a variable number of args,
> applies the rightmost of fns to the args, the next
> fn (right-to-left) to the result, etc.

For more, checkout out [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/comp)!

### How does it work?

You give `comp` a bunch of functions, and it gives you a function back.
The order in which the functions are given to `comp` determines the order in which they are applied.

[source, clojure]
```
(def article
  {:title "Donuts are your fitness friend"
   :categories [:health, :fitness, :donuts]
   :meta {:created "2010-05-09"
          :modified "2016-04-19"
          :location "cloud://articles/108"
          :author {:name "Harold Riddley"
                   :role :editor
                   :approved? true}}})

(def approved-author?
  (comp :approved? :author :meta))

(approved-author? article)
;; => true
```

I said above that order matters.
Look at the order in which the functions are given to `comp`.
We fed it `:approved?` first but `:meta` is the first applied.
