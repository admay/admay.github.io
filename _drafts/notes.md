# Writing Ideas

I have a bunch of writing ideas but I struggle with putting them on paper.

1. The value of starting a blog when you suck at writing.
2. What it's like going from a math degree to a cs degree.
3. Dependency injection in Clojure. Specifically around databases and testing.
4. How to use functional programming in code kata and real life.
5. Having vars is not evil, abusing vars is.
6. Using Ring, Lein Ring, and a good workflow.
7. Vim for Clojure. Workflow with a screen cast? (This could be really fun!)
8. Walkthrough of my vimrc fly.
9. Leveraging lein repl options?
10. Building a testable database & testing it.
11. Building a proper bashrc and bash_profile.
