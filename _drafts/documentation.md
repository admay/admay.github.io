title: Documentation for the Greater Good
category: Clojure
---

Key pieces to programming lang.
- core lang
- implementation
- runtime
- sustainability
- entry
- community
- tooling

Documentation is oft overlooked.

Clojure is a perfect example of this.

Great lang.
Strong, tight community.
lack of documentation.
poor tooling descriptions.
poor discoverability.
too many sources of truth.

== My proposal for Entry

1. Landing page
a Try clj
    - Need to let them see the language without having to install anything.
    - Quick, easy, satisfying.
2. Getting started
a Lein/boot
    - Install
    - REPL walkthrough
    - Show some requires w/ core libs
    - Explain the user ns
b LightTable
    - Install
    - Create project w/ lein or boot
    - Go to main ns
    - Eval some main- fn
    - Edit some code
    - Eval main- again
c Other IDE set-ups
    - IntelliJ
    - Atom
    - Emacs
    - Spacemacs
    - Vim
3. Discover Clojure
    - Books
    - Sites
    - Tutorials
    - Guides
    - API References
    - Clojure-docs
    - Popular Libraries
4. Community
    - Slack
    - IRC
    - Mailing list
    - subreddit
