title: Math Major to Software Engineer
date: 2017-08-30

Quick background
- math major
- always interested in tech
- took a couple of cs classes
- not a whole lot of experience
- lots of proofs and research
- number theory and fractals

What I learned as a math major
- proofs
- mathematical thought
- organization
- approach to problems
- coagulation of resources
- evolution of approach

Why I think it's useful
- approaches can evolve
- solutions are not finite
- thinking outside of the box
- connecting the dots

Why it was good for me
- I am not an algorithmic thinker
- I prefer some freedom in my approaches

Why it might not be good for you
- If you prefer 'formulaic solutions'

Math vs. CS
- Physics vs. Engineering
