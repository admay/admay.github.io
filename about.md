I'm a software engineer with a background in Math.
If you do ask me one of those questions I can't answer and I give you a bad answer, I'll probably write about it within a week.
I leave no stone un-stepped on and no crack unturned!

Ask me about:

- AWS/Cloud Services
- Clojure
- Software Reliability
- CICD/Dev Ops
