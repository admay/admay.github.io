# Admay

The name came from contorting the word lambda.

Replace the l with a lambda symbol.
Reverse it.
Drop the b.
Flip some of the letters upside down.
And boom!
Admay.

My actual name is Michael.

### Kind of meh tech blog

I want to be good at writing so I can give back to the development community but I don't enjoy it all that much.
So, through my kind of meh tech blog, I force myself to write about stuff.
There's no real direction of this website beyond "tech".
